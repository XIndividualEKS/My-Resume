    I am a passionate philomath with a deep curiosity for learning and exploring diverse fields. In my leisure time, I enjoy immersing myself in the world of movies and series, including Korean dramas, which inspire my appreciation for storytelling and cultural diversity. I find joy in swimming, a refreshing way to maintain both physical and mental well-being, and I channel my creativity through listening to and occasionally writing music. Programming is another significant passion of mine, as it allows me to combine logic and innovation to solve problems. As a gamer, I particularly enjoyed the challenges and storytelling of Sekiro and Dark Souls, which resonate with my love for strategic thinking. Additionally, I have a keen interest in reading and staying informed about geopolitics, as it helps me understand the complexities of the world and the interconnectedness of societies.
